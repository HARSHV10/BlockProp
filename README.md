# Web App and Smart Contract Project

This project is a combination of a web application built with React and Vite, and a smart contract written in Solidity. The web app interacts with the smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- Metamask (or any other Ethereum wallet)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/HARSHV10/BlockProp`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd BlockProp`
3. Install the dependencies for the web app: `cd client && npm install`

## Web App

The web app is built with React and Vite. You can start the development server with the following command: `cd client && npm run dev`. This will start the development server at `http://localhost:5173`. You can now interact with the web app and connect it to your Ethereum wallet (Metamask or any other wallet).

## Building for Production

To build the web app for production, run the following command: `cd client && npm run build`. This will create an optimized production build in the `dist` directory.
